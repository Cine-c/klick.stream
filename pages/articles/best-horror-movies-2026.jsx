          <h2>A Great Year for Horror</h2>
          <p>
            2026 is shaping up to be a banner year for horror fans. From franchise revivals to
            original concepts, the genre is thriving across theatres and streaming platforms. Here
            are the standout horror films released so far this year, ranked by our editors.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h2>The Rankings</h2>

          <h3>1. The Woman in the Yard</h3>
          <p>
            Blumhouse&apos;s psychological horror film is the year&apos;s biggest genre surprise.
            Danielle Deadwyler stars as a grieving mother haunted by a motionless figure that appears
            in her backyard every night. Director Jaume Collet-Serra builds unbearable tension through
            restraint — this is slow-burn horror at its finest. Currently streaming on Netflix.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Scream 7</h3>
          <p>
            Kevin Williamson&apos;s directorial debut breathes new life into the franchise. Neve
            Campbell&apos;s return to Woodsboro is both nostalgic and narratively earned, and the
            opening kill sequence is an all-timer. Read our <Link href="/articles/scream-7-2026-review">full
            review</Link>. In theatres now.
          </p>

          <h3>3. The Monkey</h3>
          <p>
            Osgood Perkins adapts Stephen King&apos;s short story about a cursed toy monkey that
            causes death whenever it claps its cymbals. Theo James leads a cast that plays the
            premise with dead seriousness, and the result is genuinely creepy. Streaming on Peacock.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Final Destination: Bloodlines</h3>
          <p>
            The legacy franchise returns with a fresh cast and inventive new death sequences that
            rival the series&apos; best. The opening disaster set piece on a suspension bridge is
            jaw-dropping. Tony Todd appears in a scene-stealing cameo.
          </p>

          <h3>5. M3GAN 2.0</h3>
          <p>
            The killer AI doll returns, and she&apos;s been upgraded. The sequel leans harder into
            satire of tech culture while delivering more elaborate kills and a surprisingly emotional
            core. Allison Williams and the new child lead have great chemistry.
          </p>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h3>6. Sinners</h3>
          <p>
            Ryan Coogler directs Michael B. Jordan in a period horror set in the 1930s Deep South.
            Twin brothers return home and encounter an ancient evil. Coogler brings A-list production
            values to a genre film that doesn&apos;t shy away from its Blaxploitation influences.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Companion</h3>
          <p>
            A darkly comic horror-thriller about an AI companion that becomes self-aware during a
            weekend getaway. Smart, satirical, and with a third-act twist that reframes everything
            you&apos;ve seen.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Opus</h3>
          <p>
            A journalist is invited to a reclusive pop star&apos;s compound for an exclusive,
            only to discover the gathering has a horrifying purpose. John Boyega is excellent in
            an against-type role.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Presence</h3>
          <p>
            Steven Soderbergh&apos;s haunted-house film shot entirely from the ghost&apos;s
            perspective. A bold formal experiment that creates a unique sense of voyeuristic dread.
            Lucy Liu leads the cast of a family moving into a home with a dark history.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Wolf Man</h3>
          <p>
            Leigh Whannell&apos;s reimagining of the Universal classic. Christopher Abbott plays a
            father who begins transforming after a mysterious attack. The body-horror elements are
            visceral, and the family drama gives the scares emotional stakes.
          </p>

          <h2>Still to Come in 2026</h2>
          <p>
            The rest of 2026 has plenty of horror to look forward to: <em>Anaconda: Blood Coil</em>
            (August), <em>28 Years Later</em> (June), and Jordan Peele&apos;s untitled new project
            (October). We&apos;ll update this list as new films release.
