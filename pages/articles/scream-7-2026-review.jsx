          <h2>Overview (Spoiler-Free)</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Scream 7</strong> marks the directorial debut of Kevin Williamson, the
            screenwriter who created the franchise with Wes Craven back in 1996. After the
            divisive reception of <em>Scream VI</em>, Williamson takes the reins with a clear
            mission: strip back the bloat and return to the series&apos; whodunit roots.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story brings Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) back to Woodsboro for the first time
            since <em>Scream 4</em>. A new string of Ghostface murders targets people connected to
            the events of the original 1996 killings, forcing Sidney to confront the past she
            thought she had buried.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h2>What Works</h2>
          <p>
            Williamson understands the franchise&apos;s DNA better than anyone alive, and it shows.
            The opening kill sequence is genuinely inventive — a tense, prolonged set piece that
            ranks among the series&apos; best cold opens. The meta-commentary feels fresh rather than
            exhausting, with sharp observations about true-crime culture, parasocial fandom, and the
            diminishing returns of legacy sequels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neve Campbell&apos;s return is the emotional anchor the film needs. Sidney feels
            lived-in and weary in a way that adds genuine weight to the proceedings. The supporting
            cast — including Mason Gooding, Jasmin Savoy Brown, and newcomer Isabel Merced — all
            bring energy without overshadowing the legacy characters.

        <div className="article-section">
          <h2>What Doesn&apos;t</h2>
          <p>
            The second act sags slightly as the film juggles too many suspect threads. A couple of
            red herrings feel underdeveloped, and one major character&apos;s arc resolves too neatly.
            The kills, while creative, don&apos;t quite reach the visceral intensity of
            <em> Scream VI</em>&apos;s New York set pieces.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            <em>Scream 7</em> is a confident, back-to-basics entry that proves the franchise still
            has life in it. It doesn&apos;t reinvent the formula, but it executes it with enough
            craft, wit, and genuine suspense to satisfy longtime fans and newcomers alike. In a genre
            landscape crowded with lazy reboots, Williamson&apos;s personal investment makes all the
            difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you&apos;ve ever cared about Ghostface, this is worth
            the trip to the cinema.
          </p>
