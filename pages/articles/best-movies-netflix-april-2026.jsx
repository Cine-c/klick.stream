          <h2>How We Pick</h2>
          <p>
            Every week our editors comb through Netflix&apos;s catalogue — new arrivals, trending
            titles, and overlooked gems — to bring you a curated list of films actually worth your
            time. We consider critical reception, audience scores, and our own editorial judgement.

          <h2>Top Picks for April 2026</h2>

          <h3>1. The Electric State</h3>
          <p>
            The Russo Brothers&apos; ambitious sci-fi road trip, based on Simon St&aring;lenhag&apos;s
            illustrated novel. Millie Bobby Brown stars as a teenager navigating a retro-futuristic
            landscape populated by abandoned robots. Visually stunning and emotionally grounded.
          </p>

          <h3>2. One Battle</h3>
          <p>
            The Oscar Best Picture winner finally arrives on Netflix. A devastating war drama set
            during a little-known WWII campaign, featuring career-best performances from its ensemble
            cast. Essential viewing.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Havoc</h3>
          <p>
            Tom Hardy leads this gritty action-thriller from director Gareth Evans (<em>The Raid</em>).
            A corrupt cop navigates a drug deal gone wrong across a single brutal night. The action
            choreography is world-class.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Rian Johnson&apos;s Wake Up Dead Man</h3>
          <p>
            The third Benoit Blanc mystery sees Daniel Craig&apos;s detective tackling a locked-room
            murder at a tech billionaire&apos;s island retreat. Witty, surprising, and endlessly
            rewatchable.
          </p>

          <h3>5. The Woman in the Yard</h3>
          <p>
            A slow-burn psychological horror from Blumhouse. Danielle Deadwyler delivers a
            mesmerising performance as a woman haunted by a mysterious figure that appears in her
            backyard every night at the same time.
          </p>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h3>6. Carry-On</h3>
          <p>
            This taut airport thriller starring Taron Egerton was a surprise hit in late 2025 and
            continues to be one of Netflix&apos;s most-watched films. Perfect popcorn entertainment.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Emilia P&eacute;rez</h3>
          <p>
            Jacques Audiard&apos;s genre-defying musical crime drama. Zo&euml; Salda&ntilde;a earned
            her first Oscar nomination for her role in this audacious film about a Mexican cartel
            leader who undergoes gender-affirming surgery.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Hit Man</h3>
          <p>
            Richard Linklater&apos;s darkly comedic thriller with Glen Powell as a philosophy
            professor moonlighting as a fake hitman for the police. Smart, sexy, and unpredictable.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Rebel Ridge</h3>
          <p>
            Jeremy Saulnier&apos;s intense small-town thriller about a man battling corrupt law
            enforcement. Aaron Pierre is magnetic in the lead role. One of the best action films
            of the past two years.
          </p>

          <h3>10. The Platform 2</h3>
          <p>
            The sequel to the Spanish dystopian hit expands the vertical prison concept in inventive
            and disturbing ways. Not for the faint of heart, but fans of the original will find
            plenty to chew on.
