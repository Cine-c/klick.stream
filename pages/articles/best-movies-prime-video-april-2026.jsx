            originals and licensed theatrical hits. Here are the movies we think deserve your

          <h2>Top Picks for April 2026</h2>

          <h3>1. The Accountant 2</h3>
          <p>
            Ben Affleck returns as the autistic forensic accountant who moonlights as a lethal
            vigilante. The sequel delivers more intricate financial crime plotting and bone-crunching
            action set pieces. A worthy follow-up to the 2016 original.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Saaho</h3>
          <p>
            This sprawling Indian action thriller features jaw-dropping stunt work and an
            international scope that rivals anything coming out of Hollywood. Available in Hindi,
            Telugu, and Tamil with English subtitles.
          </p>

          <h3>3. The Idea of You</h3>
          <p>
            Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine star in this charming May-December romance about
            a gallery owner who falls for a boyband frontman at Coachella. Light, fun, and
            surprisingly affecting.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Road House (2024)</h3>
          <p>
            Jake Gyllenhaal takes over the Patrick Swayze role in this reimagined action classic.
            Over-the-top fight scenes and Gyllenhaal&apos;s intense physicality make this a perfect
            Friday-night watch.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Saltburn</h3>
          <p>
            Emerald Fennell&apos;s darkly seductive thriller about obsession and class. Barry
            Keoghan is mesmerising as a scholarship student who infiltrates the world of a wealthy
            Oxford classmate (Jacob Elordi). Stylish, provocative, and impossible to forget.
          </p>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h3>6. Interstellar</h3>
          <p>
            Christopher Nolan&apos;s epic space odyssey remains one of the best sci-fi films of the
            century. Newly available on Prime Video with IMAX-enhanced visuals. If you haven&apos;t
            seen it, now is the time.
          </p>

          <h3>7. One Night in Miami</h3>
          <p>
            Regina King&apos;s directorial debut imagines a meeting between Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X,
            Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown. A powerful, dialogue-driven chamber piece about race, fame,
            and responsibility.
          </p>

          <h3>8. The Lost City</h3>
          <p>
            Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum team up for a breezy adventure-romance that channels
            the spirit of <em>Romancing the Stone</em>. Pure escapist fun with genuine laughs.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Coming 2 America</h3>
          <p>
            Eddie Murphy reprises his iconic role as Prince Akeem in this crowd-pleasing sequel.
            Not as sharp as the original, but Murphy&apos;s charisma carries it through.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Thirteen Lives</h3>
          <p>
            Ron Howard&apos;s gripping retelling of the Thai cave rescue. Viggo Mortensen and
            Colin Farrell lead an excellent ensemble in a film that prioritises tension and
            authenticity over Hollywood spectacle.
