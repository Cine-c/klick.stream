          <h2>Why These Picks</h2>
          <p>
            If you&apos;ve binged all six seasons of <em>Peaky Blinders</em> and are craving the
            same blend of sharp-suited gangsters, moral ambiguity, and period atmosphere, these
            twelve films should be at the top of your watchlist. We&apos;ve focused on movies that
            share the show&apos;s DNA: stylish crime narratives, complex antiheroes, and settings
            that feel like characters themselves.
          </p>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h2>The List</h2>

          <h3>1. The Godfather (1972)</h3>
          <p>
            The gold standard for family crime sagas. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino deliver iconic
            performances in Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s masterpiece about the Corleone dynasty. If
            Tommy Shelby had an American counterpart, it would be Michael Corleone.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Gangs of New York (2002)</h3>
          <p>
            Martin Scorsese&apos;s brutal period epic set in 1860s Manhattan. Daniel Day-Lewis is
            terrifying as Bill the Butcher. The depiction of gang warfare in a rapidly changing
            city shares thematic ground with the Shelbys&apos; Birmingham.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Legend (2015)</h3>
          <p>
            Tom Hardy plays both Kray twins in this stylish account of London&apos;s most infamous
            gangsters. Hardy&apos;s dual performance alone makes this worth watching, and the 1960s
            London setting drips with atmosphere.
          </p>

          <h3>4. A Prophet (2009)</h3>
          <p>
            Jacques Audiard&apos;s French crime masterpiece follows a young Arab man who rises
            through the ranks of a Corsican crime syndicate while in prison. Gritty, intelligent,
            and utterly compelling.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Road to Perdition (2002)</h3>
          <p>
            Tom Hanks as a conflicted mob enforcer on the run with his son during the Great
            Depression. Sam Mendes directs with painterly precision, and the father-son dynamic
            echoes Tommy&apos;s complicated family bonds.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Layer Cake (2004)</h3>
          <p>
            The film that put Daniel Craig on the radar for the Bond franchise. A London drug dealer
            tries to retire but gets pulled into one last job. Slick, twisty, and endlessly quotable.
          </p>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h3>7. Public Enemies (2009)</h3>
          <p>
            Michael Mann&apos;s stylish retelling of John Dillinger&apos;s crime spree during the
            Great Depression. Johnny Depp brings charm and danger to the role, and the period detail
            is impeccable.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Miller&apos;s Crossing (1990)</h3>
          <p>
            The Coen Brothers&apos; Prohibition-era gangster film is a masterclass in dialogue and
            atmosphere. Gabriel Byrne plays a conflicted lieutenant caught between rival mob bosses.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Eastern Promises (2007)</h3>
          <p>
            David Cronenberg directs Viggo Mortensen as a driver for the Russian mafia in London.
            Features one of the most intense fight scenes ever filmed. Dark, gripping, and superbly
            acted.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Brighton Rock (2010)</h3>
          <p>
            An adaptation of Graham Greene&apos;s novel about a young gangster in 1960s Brighton.
            Sam Riley is chillingly effective as Pinkie Brown, a sociopathic crime boss in the making.
          </p>

          <h3>11. The Departed (2006)</h3>
          <p>
            Scorsese&apos;s Oscar-winning crime thriller about moles on both sides of Boston&apos;s
            Irish mob. DiCaprio, Damon, and Nicholson at their best. The tension never lets up.
          </p>

          <h3>12. Lawless (2012)</h3>
          <p>
            Tom Hardy (again!) leads this Prohibition-era drama about bootlegging brothers in
            Virginia. Based on a true story, it shares Peaky Blinders&apos; fascination with
            family loyalty and outlaw enterprise.
