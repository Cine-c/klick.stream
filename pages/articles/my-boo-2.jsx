          <h2>The Sequel We've Been Waiting For</h2>
          <p>
            After <em>My Boo</em> became one of the biggest animated surprises of 2025 — earning
            over $400 million worldwide on a modest budget — a sequel was inevitable. <strong>My Boo 2</strong> brings
            back the beloved ghost-human duo for another heartfelt adventure that promises bigger
            scares, bigger laughs, and an even more emotional story about friendship beyond the grave.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original film charmed audiences with its unique premise: a lonely teenager who
            befriends a misfit ghost, and together they must save their town from a corporate
            developer who unknowingly threatens the spirit world. The sequel picks up six months
            later as new supernatural threats emerge and their bond is tested like never before.

          <h2>What to Expect</h2>
          <p>
            Director Chris Williams has confirmed that <em>My Boo 2</em> will explore the
            "rules" of the spirit world more deeply, introducing new ghost characters and expanding
            the mythology established in the first film. The sequel reportedly features several
            sequences set entirely in the ghost realm, requiring a visual overhaul that took the
            animation team over a year to develop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early test screenings have been overwhelmingly positive, with audiences praising the
            film's ability to balance genuine horror moments with the heartwarming friendship at
            its core. The film is expected to be a major contender for the Animated Feature Oscar.
