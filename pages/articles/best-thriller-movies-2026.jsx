          <h2>How We Ranked These</h2>
          <p>
            We combined critical consensus, audience scores, and our own editorial assessment to rank
            the standout thrillers of 2026. This list will be updated throughout the year as new
            films are released.

        <div className="article-section">
          <h2>The Rankings</h2>

          <h3>1. Drop</h3>
          <p>
            A woman receives anonymous threatening texts during a first date. Director Christopher
            Landon crafts real-time tension in a single-location setting. Meghann Fahy and Brandon
            Sklenar have electric chemistry, and the twists keep landing. Currently streaming on Hulu.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Havoc</h3>
          <p>
            Gareth Evans returns with a brutal, neon-soaked crime thriller. Tom Hardy plays a corrupt
            detective navigating a drug deal gone catastrophically wrong over one night. The action
            sequences are among the best of the decade. Streaming on Netflix.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Black Bag</h3>
          <p>
            Steven Soderbergh&apos;s latest is a lean, cerebral spy thriller. Cate Blanchett and
            Michael Fassbender play married intelligence operatives who suspect each other of
            treason. Smart, restrained, and endlessly re-watchable.
          </p>

          <h3>4. The Woman in the Yard</h3>
          <p>
            Blumhouse&apos;s psychological horror-thriller hybrid. Danielle Deadwyler delivers a
            tour-de-force performance as a woman terrorised by a mysterious figure. Slow-burn dread
            with a devastating payoff.
          </p>

          <h3>5. G20</h3>
          <p>
            A political action-thriller set during a hostage crisis at the G20 summit. Viola Davis
            commands every frame as the US President forced to negotiate with terrorists. Big,
            propulsive, and surprisingly timely.
          </p>

        <div className="article-section">
          <h3>6. Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</h3>
          <p>
            Rian Johnson&apos;s third Benoit Blanc mystery trades tropical locales for a gothic
            island retreat. Daniel Craig is in top form, and the puzzle-box plotting is the
            series&apos; tightest yet. Streaming on Netflix.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Scream 7</h3>
          <p>
            Kevin Williamson returns to the franchise he created with a back-to-basics entry that
            proves Ghostface still has bite. Our <Link href="/articles/scream-7-2026-review">full
            review</Link> breaks down why it works.
          </p>

          <h3>8. The Accountant 2</h3>
          <p>
            Ben Affleck&apos;s sequel improves on the original with tighter plotting and better
            action. The forensic-accounting-meets-assassin concept remains unique in the action
            genre.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Cloak &amp; Dagger</h3>
          <p>
            A sleek espionage thriller from Apple TV+ about rival intelligence agents in Cold War
            Berlin. Pedro Pascal and Florence Pugh bring movie-star charisma to a John le Carr&eacute;-style
            narrative.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Caught Stealing</h3>
          <p>
            Darren Aronofsky directs Austin Butler in a frenetic New York City crime thriller about
            a bartender who ends up with a bag of stolen money. Gritty, kinetic, and unapologetically
            pulpy.
