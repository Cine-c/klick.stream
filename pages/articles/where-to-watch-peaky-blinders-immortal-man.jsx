          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Shelby saga reaches the big screen. <strong>Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man</strong> is
            the highly anticipated feature-film continuation of the BBC/Netflix series that captivated
            audiences for six seasons. Directed by Tom Harper and written by creator Steven Knight,
            the film picks up in the aftermath of World War II as Tommy Shelby faces one final
            reckoning with both his enemies and his own legacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Cillian Murphy reprising his BAFTA-nominated role and a supporting cast that
            includes Barry Keoghan and Rebecca Ferguson, this is positioned as one of the biggest
            event films of 2026.

            Creator Steven Knight has confirmed the film will serve as a definitive ending to
            Tommy Shelby&apos;s story, while also laying groundwork for potential spin-off projects
            set in the same universe.

          <h2>What to Expect</h2>
          <p>
            Set in the late 1940s and early 1950s, <em>The Immortal Man</em> reportedly deals with
            the dawn of the Cold War and Tommy&apos;s entanglement with emerging geopolitical
            power plays. Expect the signature blend of stylish violence, family drama, and
            period atmosphere that made the series a cultural phenomenon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The production shot across Liverpool, Manchester, and several locations in continental
            Europe. Cinematographer George Steel (who shot the final two seasons) returns to give the
            film the same moody, desaturated look fans love.
